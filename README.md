# FDV-AI-Intern-Task

1. **Week-1 Task: EDA and Predictive Model**
   - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) involves understanding and visualizing data to gain insights before building a predictive model. Explored features, distributions, correlations, potential outliers and Data Cleaning.
   - The predictive model is  a RandomForestregression (predicting a continuous value).
2. **Week-2 Task-1: Cardiovascular Disease Prediction Model**
   - Worked with a dataset related to cardiovascular health (e.g., heart disease risk factors).
   - The goal is to build a model that predicts whether an individual has cardiovascular disease based on features like age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, etc.

3. **Week-2 Task-2: Predictive Model based on Aviation Dataset**
   - This task involves working with aviation-related data.
   - Created a predictive model (e.g., using machine learning algorithms) to address a specific problem related to aviation safety, efficiency, or performance.

4. **Week-3 Task: Predictive Model for Identifying Devanagari Characters**
   - Devanagari is the script used for several South Asian languages, including Nepali.
   - Built a model that can recognize and classify Devanagari characters (letters) based on input images which can be given via Fastapi.

5. **Week-4 Task: Classification of Nepali News into Different Categories**
   - Worked with a dataset of Nepali news articles.
   - The goal is to create a model (using recurrent neural networks like RNN, LSTM, or GRU) that can classify news articles into different categories (e.g., politics, sports, entertainment)and make a Fastapi for it.

6. **Week-6 Task: Chatbot System with Memory Retention**
   - Developed a chatbot system that can retain memory creating a conversational AI that remembers context from previous interactions.
   - Design a memory mechanism to store and retrieve relevant information during conversations using Huggingface and Langchain.
